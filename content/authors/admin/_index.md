\- *Curiosity and Enthusiasm* \-

Welcome to Chengyu Dong's homepage! My name in Chinese is 董(supervise)城(city wall)昱(sunlight :sunny:). I am an enthusiastic researcher in machine learning, particularly interested in robust learning and few-shot learning. My vision is to uncover the learning process in a principled way. I was a researcher in astronomy, interested in solar system dynamics.

I love soccer :soccer:. I used to play every week before the pandemic era. My favourite club is [Dortmund](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/clubs/borussia-dortmund/news). DM me if you want to watch soccer games together :dog:!
